# FundingRate
Funding Rate application for cryptocurrencies.

This application aggregates the predicted funding rate data from exchanges like ByBit, Binance and displays it in a Pager. This app is designed for crypto traders who need real-time funding rate prediction data for basis trading. The data is refreshed every 60 seconds based on a timer. It uses Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Flow, Retrofit, and Hilt for dependency injection.

OKX and other exchange data, along with sorting capabilities, will be added to the app in the future.
